# Transparent Public Infrastructure Bidding

A blockchain-based platform for fair, transparent, and accountable public infrastructure procurement.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized solution for public infrastructure bidding processes. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a tamper-proof, transparent system that ensures fairness in government contracting while reducing corruption and increasing public trust in the procurement process.

## Core Components

### Project Specification Contract
- Defines detailed requirements and parameters for public works projects
- Stores technical specifications, timelines, and budget constraints
- Maintains a versioned history of any specification changes
- Implements standardized formats for consistent project comparison
- Provides secure access controls for authorized modifications

### Contractor Qualification Contract
- Validates bidder credentials, certifications, and past performance
- Manages pre-qualification processes for potential contractors
- Verifies financial capacity and bonding capabilities
- Tracks contractor compliance history and quality ratings
- Implements objective qualification criteria to prevent favoritism

### Bid Submission Contract
- Securely records and encrypts proposal details until bid closing
- Ensures confidentiality during the active bidding period
- Provides cryptographic proof of submission timing
- Prevents unauthorized access to competing bids
- Creates immutable record of original bid documents

### Evaluation Contract
- Applies predefined, objective criteria to evaluate all proposals
- Implements scoring mechanisms with transparent weighting factors
- Records detailed justification for selection decisions
- Provides automated detection of abnormal or suspicious bids
- Creates comprehensive audit trail of the evaluation process
